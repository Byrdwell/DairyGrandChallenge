## Introduction

The Dairy Grand Challenge is a [U.S. Dept. of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/), [Agricultural Research Service](https://www.ars.usda.gov/)
initiative that was originally envisioned as a trans-disciplinary group of researchers 
brought together to share data and insights across various branches of science including
dairy science, soil science, microbiology, nutrition science, analytical chemistry, 
functional food development, and others. The goal of this trans-disciplinary group is
to increase the impact of research by combining results from disparate areas to allow
correlations and wider overall trends to become evident, leading to greater understanding
of the impacts of dairy products on health (cow and human), human nutrition, the environment,
and dairy product usefulness and quality.

   A key resource that allows experimental diets to be tested on a working herd of dairy
cattle is the USDA, ARS, [U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center](https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/madison-wi/us-dairy-forage-research-center/) in Madison, WI.
Among the goals of the USDFRC are:

1) Dairy Forage: 
Enhance the productivity, efficiency, and environmental sustainability
of integrated dairy and forage systems through development of improved traditional 
and novel forages and management strategies.

2) Dairy Nutrition: 
Enhance the production capacity, efficiency, product quality and sustainability
of diary systems through better understanding and management of the factors and 
relationships affecting dairy cattle nutrition.

3) Dairy Environment:
Reduce the environmental footprint of the U.S. dairy industry and maximize relevant 
ecosystem services through technology transfer initiatives addressing the prominent
bio-physical, socio-economic and operational features of dairy production systems.

A second important resource is the USDA, ARS, [Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/), 
which has the mission to define, through research, the role of foods and their components 
in optimizing human health and reducing the risk of nutritionally related disorders. 
Scientists at the Center conduct research to understand how the needs for dietary components 
are influenced by genetic, physiological state, social/behavioral dynamics, and environmental 
factors. The research is aimed at understanding the relationship between eating decisions 
coupled with insults (excess calories, viruses, bacteria, and environment pollutants) on the 
quality of life and overall health as a function of age, gender, and ethnicity for U.S. citizens.

A third important collaboration is with the [Dairy and Functional Foods Research](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/wyndmoor-pa/eastern-regional-research-center/dairy-and-functional-foods-research/) group at the
USDA, ARS, Eastern Regional Research Center. Their mission is to solve critical problems in 
utilization of milk and of fruit and vegetable byproducts from specialty crops by creating 
new concepts in science and technology to develop high-quality, value-added functional foods 
and consumer products that help improve human health and well-being.

A crucial academic partner is the [University of California at Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) [Food Science and 
Technology](https://foodscience.ucdavis.edu/) group. Collaborative work there focuses on milk functional glycomics. 
Research there combines an understanding of the chemical and biological properties of food components with analytics 
and engineering to characterize, bioseparate and biointegrate bioactive compounds in foods. In connection with this aim, 
research spans: i) analytical discovery of complex carbohydrates and peptides by advanced Mass Spectrometry, 
ii) development of efficient separation systems to isolate the identified carbohydrates in foods and food by-products, and 
iii) elucidation of the specific interactions of carbohydrates with the human body and demonstrate the health benefits.
